# Write a loop to generate the lyrics of 99 bottles of beer.

# “99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
# 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
# [...]
# 1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
# Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.
# No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. 
# Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.“

Note: You can use a while loop instead of times.
# You'll need to:
# - use string interpolation "#{number_of_bottles}"
# - use while loop or times loop
# - do take note of the "bottles" and "bottle"
